OJ has been putting out music under numerous projects for many years, but it's time he has it all collected in one place! ## What It Will Look Like ## Presented will be a collection of music that OJ has already made (stored in the site database) and he will also have a form where he can upload new projects as well. He can edit past projects (such as making a change if he realized he forgot to add a credit etc.), and delete them too (maybe some things are better off not shared with the world..) ## Links ## [**Trello Board**](https://trello.com/b/qBIVEiHz/ojcamp)",
